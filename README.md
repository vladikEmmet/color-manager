# Color Manager
### The project was created as an alternative to the popular [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website using Javascript.

The project uses the [Chroma.js](https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/) library for fast and flexible color management in different formats.

The application allows you to flexibly manipulate color palettes and customize color schemes. The ability to export the result in the following options is also available:
- **PDF file**;
- **CSS variables** for each color in the palette;
- **URL** with the ability to share the result;
- **XML document**;


### Future development should focus on:
- Expanding palette export options (png, svg, etc.)
- Adding the ability to save the result to a user account
- More precise work with color (in particular with gradient)
